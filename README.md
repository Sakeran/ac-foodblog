## Spring 2021 Web Development Challenge - Food Blog Design

This is the second project in my [Spring 2021 - Web Development Challenge](https://10in30.alexander-morse.com/) series, where I am attempting to design, code, and ship ten different web projects in the space of one month, under a variety of constraints.

This second project is a front-end design challenge, using the Parcel bundler along with Less to create a design for a sweets-focused food blog.
